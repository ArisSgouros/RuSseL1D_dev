* chainshape_free and qfree.txt.out were changed to chainshape_matrix.out.txt
  and qmatrix.out.txt

* the printing of the outputs is performed inside the corresponding
  subroutines

* q is not divided and multiplied by r outside the edwards diffusion
  subroutine

* Simpson, brush_thickness, part_fun and convolution routines were made pure

* fixed a bug where iow and ior were initialized after the parser routine.

* a) fixed a bug in chainshape routine. (qshape was allocated to nx, nx instead
  of nx, ns)
  b) the same bug was met in the adsfree routine (qads_final)

* the grafting node is now set to a specific distance.
  the initialization of the q's and the energies subroutine are now consistent
  with this

* fixed the boundary conditions (Neumann/Dirichlet) in subroutines chainshape
  and ads_free

* fixed initial value of grafted chains in chainshape.f90 for grafted chains

* distance in hamaker potential was set to be the surfeca-surface one, h12 = dx*nx-a1

* the constants were removed from parser_vars module and were appended into a
  new module named constants.f90

* removed the edwards part from chainshape_free.f90 and chainshape_grafted.f90

* renamed chainshape_free.f90 to chainshape_matrix.f90

* removed the edwards part from ads_free.f90

* moved export section from the end of ads_free.f90 to main.f90

* moved export section from the end of chainshape_matrix.f90 to main.f90

* moved export section from the end of chainshape_grafted.f90 to main.f90

* merged chainshape_matrix.f90 and chainshape_grafted.f90 into chainshape.f90
