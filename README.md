# RuSseL1D
Fortran code applying the finite differences method to run one-dimensional calculations based on self-consistent field theory. At the moment, the code can address homopolymer melts in contact with solid surfaces. The latter can be either bare or grafted with polymer chains with the same chemical identity as the matrix.
