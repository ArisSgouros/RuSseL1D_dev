RuSseL1D is a code developed in Fortran which applies the Finite Differences method to run one-
dimensional calculations on heterogeneous polymer systems, based on Self-Consistent Field Theory (SCFT).
At the moment, the code can address homopolymer melts in contact with solid surfaces and provides with
useful results regarding the thermodynamics and the structural properties of the system. The solid
surfaces can be either bare or grafted with polymer chains of the same chemical identity as the matrix 
chains.

The RuSseL1D repository includes the following files and directories:

README          current file
LICENSE         the GNU General Public License of the code (GPL)
CMakeLists.txt  file controlling the compilation process
clean.sh        bash script removing all files built by CMake
doc/            directory containing code documentation 
examples/       directory containing simple test problems
src/            directory containing the fortran source files
run/            directory  where the generated executable file is dropped after compilation
tools/          directory containing the pre- and post-processing tools of the code
test_integrity/ directory containing integrity tests

To configure and compile the code, type the following commands inside the root directory of the code:
    cmake .
    make
After successful compilation, the executable RSL1D is created inside the run/ directory
