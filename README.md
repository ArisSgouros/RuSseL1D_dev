RuSseL1D is a code developed in Fortran which applies the Finite Differences method to run one-dimensional calculations on heterogeneous polymer systems, based on Self-Consistent Field Theory (SCFT). At the moment, the code can address homopolymer melts in contact with solid surfaces and provides with useful results concerning the thermodynamics and the structural properties of the system. The solid surfaces can be either bare or grafted with polymer chains of the same chemical identity as the matrix chains.

The RuSseL1D repository includes the following files and directories:
